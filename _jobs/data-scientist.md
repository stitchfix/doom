We work on problems that you won't find in a text book, but more likely in obscure academic literature. Nine out of ten times we have to create our own models to find solutions, with a healthy dose of creativity. Do you want to push the boundaries of data science and define the next stage of the field? This is where you come in: We want you to innovate our algorithms and better grok the data, leveraging every bit of our data and pioneer cutting-edge analysis to make it happen.

Your workflow will be well oiled by our data, which is clean and information-dense. You will be autonomous from end-to-end where you get to do the whole stack without having to wait on others. You will discuss and share mathematical and programmatic challenges amongst your stellar peers. We foster an environment to make things happen, keep you constantly challenged and learn new things everyday.

# We get excited about candidates who have the following

- MS or PhD in subjects ranging from mathematics, astrophysics, to cognitive neuroscience
- Strong skills in statistics, probability, and/or machine learning
- Fluent in R, Python, or Julia
- Adept in relational databases / SQL
- Experience using Dynamo, Cassandra, Hbase or other non-relational DB
- Are scrappy, thrive on autonomy and are a great communicator
- Have an innate curiosity and bias to action
- Identify what's important, and what's not
- Highly skilled in data visualization (big plus)
- Recognizes that simple is sometimes best (Occam was right)
