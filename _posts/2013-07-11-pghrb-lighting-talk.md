Tonight [Jon Dean](http://jonathandean.com) will be giving a lighting talk at the [Pittsburgh Ruby User Group](http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/) to talk about why business logic in Rails applications should be moved out of the model and into pure Ruby classes. If you're in the Pittsburgh area be sure to stop by and introduce yourself!
