The frequentist paradigm enjoys the most widespread acceptance for
statistical analysis. Frequentist concepts such as confidence intervals
and p-values dominate introductory statistics curriculums from science
departments to business schools, and frequentist methods are still the
go-to tools for most practitioners.

However, all practitioners in data science and statistics would benefit
from integrating Bayesian techniques into their arsenal. This post
discusses two reasons why:

1.  Bayesian statistics offers a framework to handle uncertainty
    that is based on a more intuitive mental model than the
    frequentist paradigm.

2.  Bayesian regression has close ties to regularization techniques while also
    giving us a principled approach to explicitly expressing prior beliefs. This
    helps us combat multicollinearity and overfitting.


###Confidence Interval or Credible Interval?
There’s a common misperception of what the confidence interval really is.
In many cases, what you may be seeking is a Bayesian credible interval.

####The Confidence Interval: The data is random, the parameter is fixed
The confidence interval is the most commonly used frequentist tool. It
works like this: Let’s say we want to test the hypothesis that the
average American male is \\( 177 \\) cm tall. Let’s also assume that we have a
random sample of American males, and the average height of the sample is
\\( 171 \\) cm with a standard error of \\( 2 \\) cm. The lower limit of a \\( 95 \% \\)
confidence interval is then  \\( 171-2\ \times 1.96 = 167 \\), and the upper limit is
\\( 171 + 2 \times 1.96 = 175 \\).

Since \\( 177 \\) cm is not inside the confidence interval, we reject the
hypothesis that the true average height of all American males is \\( 177 \\) cm.
On the surface, this sounds straightforward, but what does a confidence
interval *really* say? It says that if we were to draw, say, \\( 100 \\) more
samples from the same population, and calculate \\( 100 \\) different confidence
intervals, approximately \\( 95 \\) of them would contain the *true average
height* of American males.

However, a common interpretation of the confidence interval is: "there
is a \\( 95 \% \\) probability that the true average height is between \\( 167 \\) cm and
\\( 175 \\) cm." Here's why that's a misinterpretation:

-   In the frequentist paradigm, the *parameter (average height) is
    fixed and unknown*, *while the data is random*. As shown above,
    the confidence limits vary while the parameter we are trying to
    make an inference about is fixed and unknown.

-   Thus the true mean is either inside or outside the confidence
    interval we are observing from our sample - there is no measure of
    probability here.

-   But *before* you draw your sample you *can* say there's a \\( 95 \% \\) chance
    that the resulting confidence interval will contain the true
    parameter. This is often gets confused with what happens *after*
    the sample has been drawn - thus the misperception of the
    confidence interval

####The Credible Interval: The data is fixed, the parameter is random
In the Bayesian paradigm, it’s the parameter that is random while the
data is fixed. This paradigm seems logical: it's not just that the data
is fixed in Bayesian inference - the data is fixed in reality,
regardless of the paradigm. The one thing we know is that we measured
three people's heights, and they were \\( 154 \\), \\( 187 \\), and \\( 172 \\) cm. There's no
randomness here.

Bayesian analysis is formalized by creating a prior belief and combining
it with the likelihood (observed data) to get to the *posterior
distribution* (the final distribution). Priors encode the information
that you already have - i.e., they are a way of expressing the results
of previous experiments. In other words, yesterday’s posterior is
today’s prior.

This is done via Bayes Theorem, which says that the posterior
distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the
priors:

$$ p(\mu \mid x) \propto \mathrm{likelihood} \times \mathrm{prior} = p(x \mid \mu) \times p(\mu) $$

![Distributions](/assets/images/blog/dists.png)

From the posterior distribution we can get the average and the credible
interval (i.e. the uncertainty). On the surface, a credible interval
looks just like the type of confidence interval we calculated above with
an upper and lower limit. But here you can make probability statements
such as \\( P( \mathrm{true\, height\, in\, interval}) = 95 \% \\), which is often what we are
seeking. We want to know the probability that the parameter lives in the
interval and not the proportion of times we'd expect the true parameter
to fall within the interval bands if we ran the experiment a large
number of times. This is a more intuitive way to think about
uncertainty.

###Bayesian Regression is a Shrinkage Estimator
In this section we turn our attention to regression analysis. As stated above, the Bayesian paradigm provides several benefits when fitting regression models.

In a Bayesian regression model the slope coefficients follow prior
random distributions:

![eq1](/assets/images/blog/eq1.png)

where the diagonal matrix, \\( A \\), is called the precision matrix
(“tightness” of our priors). Note that this is different from the
classical model where the coefficients are unknown constants.

If our priors are *normally distributed*, the estimator for the
posterior mean can be written as:

![eq2](/assets/images/blog/eq2.png)

Note that the posterior is a weighted average of the [ordinary least
squares
estimate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares)
(OLS) and the prior belief. Hence, the Bayesian regression model is a
*shrinkage estimator* in the sense that it shrinks the slope posteriors
towards the prior means ([Bayesian Statistics and Marketing, Rossi et al, 2006](http://www.perossi.org/home/bsm-1)).

In fact, Bayesian regression has close ties to regularization
techniques. Ridge regression can be thought of as a Bayesian regression
where slope priors are normally distributed with means equal to 0. Lasso
regression can be interpreted as a Bayesian regression with Laplace
priors on the slopes.

####Two Commonly Encountered Problems in Regression Analysis

Most of us have heard of [*multicollinearity*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) (correlated
regressors/drivers) and [*overfitting*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) (e.g., having too many parameters
compared to observations). Multicollinearity can cause inflated
coefficient standard errors, nonsensical coefficients, and a singular
sample covariance matrix. Overfitting leads to models that describe
random error noise instead of real relationships. Simply put, both
issues can lead to models that do not make sense.

So how do we deal with this in a classical (non-regularized) frequentist
model? We can try techniques such as [principal component analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), change time lags (for times
series) or even remove business drivers that have non-intuitive
coefficients. But such strategies offer little chance of getting an
interpretable and robust model if the input data is thin and/or plagued
by collinearity. We need to use a more forceful tool - we need to take
control of the assumptions of our model.

####Bayesian Regression and Regularization: Closely Related Cousins

Like [regularization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)) techniques, Bayesian regression offers a potent (but
not surefire) weapon against overfitting and multicollinearity. By
influencing our model with outside information, we can ensure that the
model stays within reason.

For example, let’s say that I am building a regression model to analyze
the impact of pricing changes across time. But history is limited, price
is correlated with other drivers, and the resulting model is
counterintuitive. We don’t have another year to wait for the data to
mature, but we do have an outside study which suggests that the average
industry price elasticity is \\( -0.8 \\). In a classical frequentist model, we
would have no way of combining these two pieces of information to ensure
a useful model, but in a Bayesian model we do.

Now let’s consider the use case where we don’t have a prior, but just
want to make sure the model does not go crazy by reducing the prior
variance (shrinking). Tightening the variance increases the diagonal of
the \\( A \\) matrix, which in turn increases the diagonal of the \\( X^{\prime} X \\)
matrix during estimation (see formula for the posterior above). This
makes our model less susceptible to being plagued by variance inflation
and singularity of the sample covariance matrix. This is the same idea
employed by the regularization techniques described earlier.

A third use case is the Hierarchical Bayes model where we leverage the
hierarchical structure of a dataset (if present) to create a prior structure,
and the amount of shrinkage induced is informed by the data. This technique is
particularly powerful when estimating effects at a granular level, e.g., at the
individual level, because the model allows the slope estimate for an individual
to "borrow" information from similar individuals.

###Last Word

Bayesian statistics offers a framework to handle uncertainty that is,
based on a more intuitive mental model than the frequentist paradigm.
Moreover, Bayesian regression shares many features with its powerful
regularization cousins while also providing a principled approach to
explicitly express prior beliefs.

One criticism of Bayesian methods is that priors can be subjective
assumptions. This is true, but it is hard to avoid assumptions in
statistical analysis. For example, frequentist methods are typically
based on several assumptions such as normally distributed errors,
independent observations and asymptotic convergence across infinite
repetitions. These can be hard to verify, and violations can impact
results in a non-trivial manner. The good news is that the Bayesian
paradigm is transparent due to its simplicity. We have Bayes theorem,
some priors, and that’s it. You may make the wrong assumption, but it is
stated loud and clear and you can work from there as you learn more.

Does this mean that we should all be Bayesians? I would argue that,
rather than defining ourselves as frequentists and Bayesians, pragmatism
should always be the guiding principle in data science and statistics.
Proclaiming to be a pure frequentist or Bayesian is sort of like voting
along party lines – i.e., making principle-based decisions that are not
always best for the constituents (business partners and customers).

Moreover, Bayesian analysis does have some disadvantages that we need to
be aware of:

-   You need a prior, and sometimes you just don’t have one. The wrong
    prior can send you down the wrong path. We should note that a
    Bayesian regression with no prior yields the same answer as a
    classical OLS model.

-   The typical Bayesian problem yields a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
    (MCMC) problem that’s more complex and expensive than the typical
    closed-form frequentist solution. However, MCMC is not as hard to
    deal with as it used to be. These days there are great
    off-the-shelf packages that can handle just about any MCMC
    problem.

-   This is not a disadvantage, but an important point: when dealing
    with large and clean samples, confidence intervals and credible
    intervals tend to converge.

Being pragmatic means using the right tool for the problem at hand -
regardless of what the paradigm is called. At Stitch Fix, for example,
we use both approaches every single day. When we’re analyzing a
clinically designed A/B test, we use confidence intervals and p-values
to make our decision. But we may use Bayesian techniques when we are
analyzing less randomized data, such as price and marketing levers.
